# Desktop Apps

Most streaming services don't provide desktop clients for Linux.

If you use self-hosted streaming services, however, then you're in luck. Those generally have a Linux desktop version.

* The desktop applications in this guide (Jellyfin and Kodi) both have web versions as well. So if you'd rather use the web versions, just skip this section.

Assuming you've got flatpak/flathub setup per the earlier step in this repository, you can check the [services list](services/README.md) for instructions on how to install some common streaming software.
