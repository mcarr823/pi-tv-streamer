# Install

## Manual

To setup your device, follow the below instructions in order.

Steps 6 and 8 are optional, but recommended.

* Note that some of these steps require you to log in and out. So it's easier if you have these instructions open on your phone or desktop PC, rather than trying to read them on the Raspberry Pi itself.
