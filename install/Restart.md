# Finish Setup

Once you've finished adding streaming services, open a terminal and run:

`sudo systemctl restart lightdm`

Or you can just reboot, if you prefer.

Either way, you should end up on the login screen.

* You'll end up on the desktop instead if you have auto-login enabled. If that's the case, logout.

From the login screen, click on the wrench icon up the top right side of the screen. It will provide you with a list of different desktop environments.

Choose Plasma (Wayland).

Plasma Bigscreen (X11) will also work, if you prefer X11 over wayland.

If you don't know what that means, just choose Plasma Bigscreen without X11.

Once you've made your choice, login.

## Kubuntu 24.04.1

On Kubuntu, or other operating systems with KDE Plasma by default, the session chooser is down the bottom left.

Click on "Desktop Session: Plasma (X11)" to choose a different session, per the Raspberry Pi OS instructions above.

## Tada!

If everything went well, you should now be greeted with a smart TV-like user interface.

You should see tiles for your streaming services, and selecting one should launch the web version of that streaming service.
