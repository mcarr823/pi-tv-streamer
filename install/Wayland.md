# Wayland or X11

* If you don't know or care about Wayland vs X11, just go with X11 and skip to the next step.

## Pick a display stack

When running your media center, you will have the option of using either the Wayland or X11 version of Plasma Bigscreen.

I won't go into the differences between Wayland and X11 here. Most of this guide will work with either.

However, there is one area where this decision matters greatly: support for gamepads/remote controls.

Remotes and gamepads will work with Kodi regardless of whether you're using Wayland or X11.

Other applications which don't natively support remote controls, however, will only work with X11 (more on that later in the Remote Control section).

So let me keep this simple:

- if you plan on using a keyboard/mouse instead of a remote/gamepad, or if you only plan on using Kodi, then pick Wayland
- if not, pick X11

This decision will matter during the remote control setup section, and when picking a desktop environment. So it's better to make this decision early on.

* You can change your mind later, but you may need to revisit some steps
