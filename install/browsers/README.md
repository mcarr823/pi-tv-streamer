# Web Browser

Some streaming services will not be possible to run through a desktop application, and will instead require you to run the web version.

For those services, you will need to pick a browser and create desktop icons (tiles on the homescreen) to run those services.

Using a web browser can also be desirable if you're streaming videos from a separate device, such as a NAS, and that device is running Kodi or Jellyfin.

## Pick A Browser

Raspberry Pi OS comes with both Firefox and Chromium installed by default.

Either one is suitable for this project.

I would recommend Chromium for ease of setup, since Firefox doesn't support PWAs (progressive web apps).

Also, some streaming services artificially restrict Firefox to lower resolution videos, or only "officially" support Chrome-based browsers.

That being said, either browser will work. So pick your favorite and we'll continue.

- [Chromium](Chromium.md)

- [Firefox](Firefox.md)

## Configuring Different Websites

Whichever browser you use, check the [services list](../services/README.md) for hints on how to make certain websites work better with this setup.

This might include ways to make them perform better, or make them easier to navigate.

At this point in time, the only "websites" listed are the web versions of Kodi and Jellyfin.

## Next Step

Continue to configuring your [Remote Control](../remotes/README.md)

Or skip that and go straight to [Finish Setup](../Restart.md)
