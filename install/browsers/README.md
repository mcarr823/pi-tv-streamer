# Web Browser

## Pick A Browser

Raspberry Pi OS comes with both Firefox and Chromium installed by default.

Either one is suitable for this project.

I would recommend Chromium for ease of setup, since Firefox doesn't support PWAs.

Also because some streaming services artificially restrict Firefox to lower resolution videos, or only "officially" support Chrome-based browsers.

That being said, either browser will work. So pick your favorite and we'll continue.

- [Chromium](Chromium.md)

- [Firefox](Firefox.md)

## Next Step

Continue to configuring your [Remote Control](../remotes/README.md)

Or skip that and go straight to [Finish Setup](../Restart.md)
